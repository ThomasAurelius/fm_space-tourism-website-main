## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-  View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There is a lot to making a site fully accessible. The extra mark up is time consuming, but very neccessary.

### Continued development

I will continue to work on accessibility issues and improvements.

### Useful resources

-  [Scimba course with Kevin Powell](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - I watched the whole video once before starting in on my own, without following the video. I do need to go back and watch the video to get some of the accessbility features that were new to me, implemented on the website.
